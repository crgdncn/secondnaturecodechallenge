                        There are two kinds of users: customers and admins. Both are defined in the users table. Admins have the admin flag set to true. Customers have their own model, otherwise everyone can be defined in a User model.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A customer/admin *must* register by themselves, they cannot be created by an other admin. Make sure you have seeded the database to create the first admin account [admin@sncc.test / password]. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Admins and only admins can CRUD widgets. <br>
                        Create an admin interface to manage users [optional].<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Customers can add/remove widgets to/from their account.<br>
                        Customers can ship widgets to an address they have defined [optional].
                    </p>

                        This is *not* a shopping cart application.
